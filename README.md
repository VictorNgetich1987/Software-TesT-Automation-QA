Why do I know my software, program, or code is operating and secure?

I enable functionality by writing unit tests that validate the expected behavior under different conditions, including edge cases. It is critical to test early and frequently because it guarantees defects are detected and reported before they become much more difficult to fix. I also monitor secure coding practices such as input validation, exception handling, and use of distinct identifiers for data integrity. Security is part of my design and not an add-on.

How do I use user needs and integrate them into a program?

I begin by carefully breaking down the necessities and breaking them into concise, testable functionality. Then, from there, I create classes and services that meet them head-on. I think through how someone will use the program, then translate that into validation rules, constraints, and data processing. This way, with every line of code attached to some necessity, I deliver software that truly brings value to users.

How do I design software?

I code software with modularity, testability, and maintainability in mind. I break down larger problems into smaller chunks (e.g., Contact, Task, Appointment services), making it easier to test and reuse code. I design with scalability in mind, while also supporting readability via documentation and careful naming conventions. Testing forms a key part of my design cycle; I not only write tests to verify functions, but also to influence the design process itself.
